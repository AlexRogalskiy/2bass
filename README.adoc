== Technologies used

This is a derivative of link:https://github.com/CourseOrchestra/celesta[Celesta project], in particular, it uses link:https://corchestra.ru/wiki/index.php?title=%D0%AF%D0%B7%D1%8B%D0%BA_Celesta-SQL[CelestaSQL] (documentation is currently in Russian only, but syntax diagrams for the language are self-explanatory).

== How to install

Prerequisites: JRE 1.8

Unzip package and make program's folder availiable on system path.

== How to use

* Write and modify your DB Schema using CelestaSQL, which is in fact the plain old DDL you are familiar with
(Ð•. g. you should use CREATE TABLE for table definition, simply add/modify columns in the script when you need it,
no 'ALTER' commands in schema definition script).

* Use three simple commands to operate (hi, link:https://www.terraform.io/[terraform.io]!):

** *bass apply* -- sync your actual DB structure with the desired structure described in your SQL files.
All the ALTER commands are calculated and executed automatically.

** *bass plan* -- do not sync structure, print planned ALTER script for review / manual exectution.

** *bass import* -- generate idempotent DDL script for your existing database.
